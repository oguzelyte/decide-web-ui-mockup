# DECIDe Web App UI Mockup
 Web UI mockup for the DECIDe project using Adobe XD.

 I worked on this model as part of an internship with a team of researchers from the Newcastle University.

 This model was built in the scope of a few months and is a product of in-person and virtual meetings from around April to July, 2020. 

# What Is The DECIDe Project?
 The project can be summarised as such:

 "This project proposes a collaborative, system-level modelling environment for decarbonisation and power optimisation relevant to high speed. This environment is underpinned by two key approaches: the multi-model approach to providing fully integrated models based on diverse model types for subcomponents; and the model marketplace approach which provides an accessible, secure environment for stakeholders to share and integrate data. This environment will support cost-effective, integrated modelling to identify decarbonisation benefits in a manner that encourages stakeholder engagement, including new entrants to the rail domain. This feasibility project is targeted at the needs of HS2, but is expected to have applicability across the whole rail system."
